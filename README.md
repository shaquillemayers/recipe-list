# Recipe List

This project has been deployed here: https://shaqs-recipes.surge.sh/

## Project Overview

This project stores various recipes that I've tried & tested, but are scattered in various places such as cook books, websites and notes on my phone. This project allowed me to store them all in one place for easy access as well as general access for whoever wants to try them, whilst also allowing me to practice some core React concepts such as passing props, state, React Router and the useEffect hook.

Simply click "recipes" in the navigation menu, select a recipe, and follow the instructions in the pop up modal!
